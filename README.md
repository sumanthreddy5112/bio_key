Today, most of us have already used bio-metric authentication methods, including fingerprints 
and facial recognition, on our phones and laptops. Nevertheless, these methods mostly require 
dedicated hardware, which is not available across all devices like desktop PCs and basic laptop 
models. Another problem is that the methods in use today are primarily used for single-time 
authentication. Hence, these methods are used only in the login process, and once you pass one 
of the authentication methods, the system will require no further authentication from any user 
on a specific device.
Most computers (PCs and laptops) are not equipped with the hardware required for facial 
recognition and fingerprint scanning. Therefore, an alternative biometric authentication method 
thatdoesnotrequireanydedicatedhardwarewillbenefittheaverageuserandthemanufacturing 
company by eliminating the need to include these hardware additions in the product, which will 
lower the production costs for the company and hopefully for the company and the customer. 
This project will present an approach that focuses on the most common hardware used today, 
the keyboard. Our approach is that by analyzing keystroke gestures, we can get a sufficient 
authentication of a user at the login process and during his use of the app/website.
The project document is arranged as follows. Section 2 discusses relevant background topics. 
Section 3 describes the technologies we used in our project. Section 4 will elaborate on the 
dataset we used and the data set we collected. Section 5 discusses the preprocessing we did on 
the data before starting the training. Section 6 will explain the models and their architectures. 
Lastly, Section 7 will describe the results of our research and will present what we achieved in 
comparison with other works
